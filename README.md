# elebitsDSAutoSplit
This a script for liveSplit's Scriptable Auto Splitter for the game Elebits the adventures of kai and zero running on DeSuME 0.9.11 x64.

This is designed for 7 splits (One for each world).
It will start when you load the game.
It should finish when the screen turns black for the credits, but isn't perfect.
