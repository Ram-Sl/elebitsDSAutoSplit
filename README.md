# elebitsDSAutoSplit
This a script for liveSplit's Scriptable Auto Splitter for the game Elebits the adventures of kai and zero running on DeSmuME 0.9.11 x64.

It will start when you load the game.

It will split everytime you enter a new world. So you should set up your splits like this:

It will finish as the screen turns black for the credits (Not perfect but close enough).
